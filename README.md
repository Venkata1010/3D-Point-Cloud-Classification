# 3D Point Cloud Classification
Utilized the Princeton ModelNet dataset, a curated 3D CAD model, to perform accurate classification of common objects.
Built a modified PointNet architecture for 3D point cloud data, achieving 94% classification accuracy, surpassing traditional models like Random Forest and SVM. Optimized hyperparameters to further enhance model performance.
